    <div class="text">
        <p>Sponge Attack is an exciting local game where you fight for your survival against another player. Hereâ€™s how
            the game works:<br>
            <br>

            Name Entry: At the beginning of the game, you will be prompted to enter your name. This helps to identify
            your character in the game and allows other players to recognize you.

            Character Selection: After entering your name, you can choose your character. There are various characters
            to choose from, each with unique abilities and traits.

            Rolling for Life: Once all players have selected their characters, the actual fight for survival begins. The
            game uses a dice system where each player rolls the dice in each round. The dice results determine whether
            you attack or get attacked.

            Winning: The game ends when a player has lost all their life points. The other player is then declared the
            winner.<br> <br>

        <p>The selection of characters is very diverse. First, you and your opponent can decide who will take the team
            with the Spongebob characters and who will take the team with the Family Guy characters. Then, each team has
            unique characters with different abilities. Here, the following characters are introduced to you!</p>
